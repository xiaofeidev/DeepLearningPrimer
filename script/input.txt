Given a video, our task is to generate detection results
for all its frames Ik, i = 0; : : : ;N. To avoid redundant
feature computation, we split the frame sequence
into segments of equal length l. In each segment Sk =
fIkl; Ikl+1; :::; I(k+1)lô€€€1g, only one frame Ikey
k (by default
we take the central frame Ikl+bl=2c) is selected for feature
extraction via the feature network Nfeat. The key feature
is propagated to remaining frames with flow-guided warping,
where the flow field is computed by a light-weight flow
network, following the practice of Deep Feature Flow [34].
Features of all frames are then fed into task network Ntask
to generate detection results.
